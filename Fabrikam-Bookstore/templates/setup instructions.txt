# First if you haven't already, clone the repo from github

# Next, using PowerShell login and set your context to the correct subscription and deploy the Ubuntu Server with the template from the repo

# Using putty or WSL (Bash shell), use ssh-keygen to create a local SSH cert if you don't already have one
ssh-keygen

# copy that cert to the Ubuntu server using ssh-copy-id
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub azureadmin@x.x.x.x

# update repos
sudo apt-get update

# install MySQL
sudo apt install mysql-server

# we need to change MySQL to listen on the network IP Address (defaults to public loop back) - go to the conf file directory
cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/

# Notice here MySQL is listening on the loopback adapter
cat mysqld.cnf | grep bind

# Get the current IP address (write it down or copy it)
ifconfig  

# Use vi to change
sudo vi mysqld.cnf
/bind
i
[change to ip address from above]

# verify
cat mysqld.cnf | grep bind

# restart service
sudo service mysql restart

# if you want to access remotely from Workbench, then you must get your IP and grant perms
<search online>

# grant perms to MySQL user (root) - if you want remote access - and to the correct ip range for the app servers
mysql -u root -p
Enter password: <enter password>
mysql>GRANT ALL ON *.* to root@'y.y.y.y' IDENTIFIED BY 'put-your-password';
mysql>GRANT ALL ON *.* to root@'10.23.1.%' IDENTIFIED BY ‘put-your-password’; 
mysql>FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql>exit

# You should now be able to access remotely
try Workbench on your local machine

# now copy the backup file over from your local repo (get into the directory via the bash shell w/ WSL)
scp dbbkp.sql azureadmin@x.x.x.x:/home/azureadmin/bkp

# ssh back into the system and restore the backup
mysql -u root -p fabrikam_bookstore < /home/azureadmin/bkp/dbbkp.sql

# verify the data has been loaded
mysql -u root -p fabrikam_bookstore
select * from books;

# Also verify from Workbench installed on your system
